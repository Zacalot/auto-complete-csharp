#+TITLE: Auto-complete source for C#

* Description
Auto-completion source for C# keywords to be used with the auto-complete package
* Dependencies
The ~auto-complete~ package
* Usage
Add ~ac-source-csharp~ to your ~ac-sources~ variable while in ~csharp-mode~
Example code:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'auto-complete-csharp)
(add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook #'(lambda ()
                                (setq ac-sources '(ac-source-csharp))
                                (auto-complete-mode)))
#+end_src
* Features
- Autocompletion for C# keywords with light documentation
* Why include only keywords?
LSP servers like ~eglot~ grant auto-completion for everything else fine.
As a result, this package is only useful if you find that LSP servers for C# run too slowly to have them prompt auto completion as you type, as is the case for me when working on Windows. So I use this package to have simple and fast completion for keywords without any LSP server lag. Feel free to extend this yourself if you need anything else.
